# Notes to self

## TODO:
* compare more than one recipe more cleanly
* standardize ingredient names
* figure out why eggs parse funny
* make function to download multiple ingredient lists
* fix the way it parses salt (probably related to eggs)

* I've got conflicts in here because I was counting on Dropbox to sync properly! But now I've got two versions of the functions file.



## TODO: higher priorty
* Make sure "salt and pepper" doesn't become "0 '' and pepper".... 
  (e.g. "Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes Recipe")
* fix search/retrieve function to ensure it actually finds recipes
* create a new script to pull recipes (ingredients and methods) from NYT Cooking. (maybe also searching)
## Next step:
* put into Shiny App to make interactive without opening R.
  
## TODO: medium priorty
* Allow scraping multiple links deep (e.g. scrap non-recipe pages for
  links to recipe pages)

## TODO: lower priorty
* compare more than one recipe more cleanly
* standardize units of measure (e.g. cups/cup = cup)
* convert units of measure? (e.g. ounces/cup/whatever => grams)
* standardize ingredient names
