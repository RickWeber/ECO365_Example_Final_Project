# All Recipes ingredient comparison tool

This project uses the `rvest` library to scrape recipe ingredients from AllRecipes.com and allow the user to compare the ingredients of different recipes. 

You can find the code in this repository and use the tool via this [Shiny app](https://rickweber.shinyapps.io/allRecipes/).

The Shiny app takes a list of urls (it only works with AllRecipes.com so far) and creates a sortable table of ingredients allowing for side-by-side comparisons of the ingredients used in different ingredients.
